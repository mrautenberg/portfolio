# Portfolio

## :memo: Short Description
First individual assignment @ KYH using React. A simple portfolio using axios, react-router-dom and functional components. Functionality and code kept as simple as possible, with a focus on introducing myself and showcasing projects.

## :construction: WIP
This is work in progress, and I am waiting to do some fancy animations and nice-to-haves until I've gotten familiar with an animation framework for React.
